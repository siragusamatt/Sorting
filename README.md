# Sorting

This was done as a Data Structures class project. I had to demonstrate that I could implement various well known sorting algorithms and come up with a way to compare them. All sorting was done on int variable types.

The algorithms implemented are:
* Bubble Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort

Thank you for viewing this project.
